Academic year: 2018-2019

Teaching coordinators: [Michalis Vazirgiannis](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Michalis.Vazirgiannis/), [Antoine Tixier](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Antoine.Tixier/), [Apostolos Papadopoulos](http://delab.csd.auth.gr/~apostol/), [Davide Buscaldi](https://sites.google.com/site/davidebuscaldi/)

> Text is found everywhere. **Text mining**, **Natural Language Processing** (NLP), **information retrieval** and **recommendation systems** are very important from an applied point of view and are highly sought after by the **GAFAM** and the industry in general. There is especially a vast industrial interest currently in **search engines**, **web marketing/advertising**, **social networks analysis**, and **recommendation systems**, which involve text to a large extent. This huge market and strong demand has made NLP a **central research field** with high visibility and impact.
